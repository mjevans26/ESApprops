Description: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), is required to create recovery
    plans for species listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered
    Species Act (ESA).  These documents specify criteria needed for species to be delisted
    , actions for achieving recovery criteria, and the amount of funding required for recovery.
    This dataset contains the funding requested in species' recovery plans,
    funding received as reported in annual FWS expenditures, and species' status
    as reported in biannual reports for all listed species with recovery plans
    written between 1984 and 2014.

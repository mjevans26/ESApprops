Description: Federal funding for the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is
    appropriated into numerous programs responsible for conserving plants and animals.
    Many of these programs cary out actions required to implement various parts of the
    US Endangered Species Act (ESA), such as consultation and species recovery.
    This dataset includes budget appropriation for programs funding endangered species
    conservation and recovery from fiscal year 1984 through 2016.
    The organization of programs changed in 2014, such that appropriations to certain programs cannot be compared
    before and after this fiscal year.

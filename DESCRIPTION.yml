Description: The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) requests that federal
    agencies and states report their expenditures on species listed under the
    US Endangered Species Act (ESA) each year. There is no differentiation
    between expenditures on compliance (e.g., section 7) and recovery actions.
    FWS then compiles a report of expenditures that they provide to Congress
    and the public. This dataset includes "Table 1" (non-land expenditures)
    from the 2004-2007 and 2014 annual expenditure reports.
